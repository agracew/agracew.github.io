    <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my newly established monthly blog post where I reflect on my
      favorite things from the month. The categories are subject to change in the future,
      and suggestions are always welcome!

  <h2>Article or otherwise useful academic resource</h2>
  <p>This section is intended to be an interesting or thought provoking journal article
     or news article that I read during the month. It's also possible it will be
   a thread from twitter. (because I follow great people with interesting
   perspectives!)</p>

  <h3><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05469-3" target="blank"><u>Bias detectives: the researchers striving to make algorithms fair</u></a></h3>
  <p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ site.github.url}}/images/blog/August/bias_detectives.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>My research advisor shared this article with us last month, and I think it's
    really important for not only researchers and people creating predictive
    algorithms and data-driven solutions,
    but also anyone who looks at the results of those and interprets any sort of
    data. We tend to think of data summaries as such objective truths without stopping
    to understand the story behind the data and what biases it may be hiding. From
    the article: “What concerns me most is the idea that we’re coming up with
    systems that are supposed to ameliorate problems [but] that might end up
    exacerbating them.” For example, predicting crime rates based on arrest
    history only tells you who is being arrested, not who is committing crimes.
    When a subpopulation is unfairly targeted for arrest (as we know is the
    case for black people in America), then an algorithm using arrest data will
    unfairly suggest that black people are a higher risk for committing crimes.

  <h2>Poem(s)</h2>

  <p>I honestly haven't read much poetry this month (we'll see how much
    worse this gets once my classes start). But I did read these two
  that are by the same author, Hieu Minh Nguyen, and on the same page. </p>

<h2>Music</h2>
</header>
  <h3>Bubblin by Anderson .Paak and Busta Rhymes</h3>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2QZBf5Rq9bCHFt7j95G4w2" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>Hello this song is so fun! I didn't find it this month, but it's one
  of the only songs I've made time for instead of the two albums I've mostly just
been listening to on repeat since they dropped this month.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Sweetener (the whole album by Ariana Grande)</h3>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1xWH8zYtDeS9mW1JJG23VZ" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>I think I'm an Ariana Grande fan now?? I've never listened to her albums before
  this one, but God is a Woman is such a jam, so I listened to it the day it dropped
and have liked it more every time I've listened since. My other favorites on the
album besides R.E.M are pete davidson, sweetener, get well soon, breathin', the light is coming (where she
defintely sounds like Gwen Stefani to me?), blazed, and also borderline. So most of them..</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Swimming (also the whole album) by Mac Miller</h3>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2JmFRXaJrkAUD2cs6U20KG" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>Look this album is great and I also didn't expect it to like it so much.
    (I mean more than I expected to like Ariana's because I actually listened
    to him before this.) Jet Fuel was my favorite on my first listen-through.
    My other favs in no order are What's the Use?, Hurt Feelings, Self Care,
    Ladders, and Dunno. </p>

    <h4>Binge Mode: Harry Potter</h4>
  </header>
  <iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/488164257&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe>
  <p> If you read my July post, you'll note that my podcast last
  month was the same (but a different episode!) I picked this episode because
  it's one of the bonus episodes (not directly about book chapters or a specific movie),
  and it talks about the significance of the Harry Potter fan community and how
  fun it's been to love Harry Potter and have people to share that with! Which
  is true! Special shoutout to my dad for reading the books with me and taking me to the
  midnight releases.</p>
    <p>For the record, I really usually listen to multiple podcasts and also like discovering
  new pods. I've even subscribed to like three new podcasts this month that
I've been unable to switch to because my life has been taken over by Harry Potter.
Ask Zack what the one video game I consistently want to play is (spoiler: it's
Lego Harry Potter. I mean this can't possibly last forever, but this has been
such a fun journey back through my favorite series of all time and such a huge
part of my childhood! I'm learning so much that I forgot! )</p>

  <h4>I got to hang out in Ann Arbor!</h4>
  <p>I think the theme of this month has been routines? I've listened to the same
  music on repeat; I've listened to the same podcast as often as they release
episodes. But it's been great! I've been writing (for my research); I started
fabric painting! (but not on any real clothes yet because I'm still intimidated).
I got to do a pub cycle with my pals (hbd LB!) I've been hanging out with Charles.
And now I'm planning a camping trip with Zack for Labor Day Weekend
(stay tuned for good or bad tales from that next month) </p>

  <p>So I guess here are some pictures of some normal stuff that I've had time
  for since it's summer:</p>

      <p>We have nice running sunrises whenever I can get myself out of bed to see
      them (special thanks to Adam Vandusen for agreeing to meet me at 7 am and
      mututally prepare for these half marathons we're definitely ready for)</p>

      <p>Food is better with pals. 10/10 would now recommend a potluck brunch.
      (good idea, Pranjal, even though I was secretly very skeptical) </p>

  <h3>This happy meal I made for myself when my roommate was gone</h3>
  <p>So this is vegetarian (not vegan), and also not really that noteworthy

homemade sweet potato fries (including the undisputably best possible combination of toppings
for sweet potato fries) and a mango lager I brought back with me from Asheville. </p>

    <p>This was bound to happen soon enough, but my person of the month this month
    is Mr. Zack Hewitt. He is an awesome human and constantly makes me feel like
  an awesome human who can take on the world! Thank you, Zack, for your love and support
 (and for flowers and chocolates and so many other things). You make my life more
fun and manageable, and I'm so happy you're in it! Even if I wish you lived a little
closer and could be in it more.</p>
