    <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my newly established monthly blog post where I reflect on my
      favorite things from the month. The categories are subject to change in the future,
      and suggestions are always welcome!

  <h2>Article or otherwise useful academic resource</h2>
  <p>This section is intended to be an interesting or thought provoking journal article
     or news article that I read during the month. It's also possible it will be
   a thread from twitter. (because I follow great people with interesting
   perspectives!)</p>

    <h3><a href="https://threader.app/thread/1014267515696922624" target="blank"><u>Some crazy insight about your eyes! (from twitter)</u></a></h3>
  <p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ site.github.url}}/images/blog/July/eye_article.png" alt="" /></span>Thanks to @Foone on twitter,
    who I actually don't follow, so I'm unfortunately unsure how this came up on my timeline, but I'm glad it did! The human body is so
    wild, and this is a crazy dive into some of the weird things about our eyes. Oh and a warning that this contains vulgar
  language, and the grammar may seem strange because it's a series of tweets pasted together.</p>

    <h3><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-an-ex-cop-rigged-mcdonalds-monopoly-game-and-stole-millions" target="blank"><u>How an Ex-Cop Rigged McDonaldâ€™s Monopoly Game and Stole Millions</u></a></h3>
    <p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ site.github.url}}/images/blog/July/mcdonalds.webp" alt="" /></span>Ok I was actually
    very set on the eye article from early in the month, but I just read this story on July 30th, and it's so crazy to me?? Like who
  knew this is what happened to McDonald's monopoly game? Some of you might've. I had no idea. So I'm sharing it.</p>

  <h2>Poem(s)</h2>

  <p>I honestly haven't read much poetry this month (we'll see how much
    worse this gets once my classes start). But I did read these two
  that are by the same author, Hieu Minh Nguyen, and on the same page. </p>

<h2>Music</h2>
</header>
  <h3>Sweetener (the whole album by Ariana Grande)</h3>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2QZBf5Rq9bCHFt7j95G4w2" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>Hello this song is so fun! I didn't find it this month, but it's one
  of the only songs I've made time for instead of the two albums I've mostly just
been listening to on repeat since they dropped this month.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Sweetener (the whole album by Ariana Grande)</h3>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1xWH8zYtDeS9mW1JJG23VZ" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>I think I'm an Ariana Grande fan now?? I've never listened to her albums before
  this one, but God is a Woman is such a jam, so I listened to it the day it dropped
and have liked it more every time I've listened since. My other favorites on the
album are pete davidson, sweetener, get well soon, breathin', the light is coming (where she
defintely sounds like Gwen Stefani to me?), blazed, and also borderline. So most of them..</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Swimming (also the whole album) by Mac Miller</h3>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2JmFRXaJrkAUD2cs6U20KG" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>Look this album is great and I also didn't expect it to like it so much.
    (I mean more than I expected to like Ariana's because I actually listened
    to him before this.) Jet Fuel was my favorite on my first listen-through.
    My other favs in no order are What's the Use?, Hurt Feelings, Self Care,
    Ladders, and Dunno. </p>

    <h4>Binge Mode: Harry Potter</h4>
  </header>
  <iframe src="https://art19.com/shows/binge-mode-game-of-thrones/episodes/338c9e73-7025-4194-8a78-0258fd8eb0ac/embed?theme=light-gray-blue" style="width: 100%; height: 200px; border: 0 none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>
  <p> If you read my July post, you'll note that my podcast last
  month was the same (but a different episode!) I picked this episode because
  it's one of the bonus episodes (not directly about book chapters or a specific movie),
  and it talks about the significance of the Harry Potter fan community and how
  fun it's been to love Harry Potter and have people to share that with! Which
  is true! Special shoutout to my dad for reading the books with me and taking me to the
  midnight releases.</p>
    <p>For the record, I really usually listen to multiple podcasts and also like discovering
  new pods. I've even subscribed to like three new podcasts this month that
I've been unable to switch to because my life has been taken over by Harry Potter.
Ask Zack what the one video game I consistently want to play is (spoiler: it's
Lego Harry Potter. I mean this can't possibly last forever, but this has been
such a fun journey back through my favorite series of all time and such a huge
part of my childhood! I'm learning so much that I forgot! )</p>

  <h2>Adventure</h2>
  </header>
  <h4>I got to hang out in Ann Arbor!</h4>
  <p>I think the theme of this month has been routines? I've listened to the same
  music on repeat; I've listened to the same podcast as often as they release
episodes. But it's been great! I've been writing (for my research); I started
fabric painting! (but not on any real clothes yet because I'm still intimidated).
I got to do a pub cycle with my pals (hbd LB!) I've been hanging out with Charles.
And now I'm planning a camping trip with Zack for Labor Day Weekend
(stay tuned for good or bad tales from that next month) </p>

  <p>So I guess here are some pictures of some normal stuff that I've had time
  for since it's summer:</p>

        <p>We had a FULL day of making jelly after we finished picking, and ended
          up with some wonderful (mostly formed) blackberry jelly and peach jelly.
          We also came home from the trip with some fresh honey from my uncle's bee
          hives.</p>

    <h2>Person</h2>
    <p>Person of the month, photo of the month - it's just a cool thing
      I want to talk about that doesn't have another category.<p>
    </header>

    <p>My person of the month this month goes to one of my very biggest supporters,
      who made the long journey to visit me in Ann Arbor while he deals with his
      own ACL injury. I am so grateful for my dad who constantly shows me
      how much he loves and supports me, even when it's hard. His knee recovery
      is still underway, and he has a second surgery upcoming, so I want to send
      him all of my love and support as he goes through this unpleasant time.</p>
      <p>He also gets a huge shoutout for always being willing to host my friends and I,
        and he's famous for always having fresh baked brownies available for everyone
        (he is possibly be the world's biggest fan of chocolate).
        He makes the best french toast, and he's already had (at least) three
        of softball's greatest comebacks through previous ACL injuries and a torn
        rotator cuff. He's the reason I'm such a big Harry Potter fan,
        football fan, and he gets some credit for getting me interested in politics.
        I don't know where I'd be without him. (I could go on for a while, but
        I'll stop for now) You're the best, dad!</p>
