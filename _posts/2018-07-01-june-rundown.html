    <p>Hello everyone! I'm starting a new monthly blog post where I reflect on my
      favorite things from the month. I may add/remove categories as I continue,
      but this is what I have for now!</p>

  <h2>Article or otherwise useful academic resource</h2>
  <p>This section is intended to be an interesting or thought provoking journal article or news article that I read during the month. Is it bad that this will sometimes be a tweet? The people I follow are so helpful!</p>

  <p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ site.github.url}}/images/blog/June/article_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></span>This month, I read an article that once again made me wonder what our future will look like as we continue to develop new technology at the rate we are. We often whisper about the ethics involved, but articles like this make me wonder how often those whispers make it to the decision-making table.</p>

    <p>This one is particularly relevant this month as our country grapples with our past, present, and future decisions around immigration. This poem breaks my heart every time I read it, but I think it's so important for everyone to read and reread and remind ourselves of the choices being made by others that we may not even be able to conceptualize.</p>

  <h5>"Make Me Feel" by Janelle Monae</h5>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5gW5dSy3vXJxgzma4rQuzH" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>This whole album is so fun and great! But this song is the one I've definitely kept on repeat this month.</p>
  <br>

  <h5>"Dining Alone" by Shakey Graves</h5>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3JSlnsGTuO1tAMpgWy7tBz" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>I got to see him live at the end of May, and this song hadn't stuck out to me until
  he performed it, explained it, and acted it out. It was great.</p>
  <br>

  <h5>"The Deep" by clipping.</h5>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6LHGNimbsz8tabfUDSujvH" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>There is so much going on in this song! It's great! And a quick preview to the podcast section - Switched on Pop is the reason I know about this song, and they have a great episode about it.</p>

  <p>Shout out to Adam Vandusen for recommending this podcast to me!! (This will likely
    be a common theme of my podcast section - he has great podcast recs). I've already told so many people about this podcast because I absolutely love it. They break down pop songs to understand all the cool hidden elements in them that we hear but may never notice. This was the first episode I heard, but so far I have listened to as many as I could and loved them all (except one).</p>

  <h4>International Conference on Transport and Health 2018</h4>
  <p>This month, I had the privilege to attend this fun and interesting conference on
    Mackinac Island, which I have to say is one of the most beautiful places I've
    ever been. We were there the week after the lilac festival, so there were beautiful
    lilacs still in bloom along with all kinds of other flowers that typically are done
    blooming by this time of the year in Asheville. There are no cars on this island that is 8 miles in circumference,
    so all transportation is through non-motorized transport like walking,
    horse-drawn carriages, and bicycles, which was interesting for the theme of
    the conference (transport and health). There are also twelve(12!) fudge shops on
    this tiny island, which I suppose was less perfect for the health part of the theme.
     I was able to bring my mom with  me, which made it even more fun, and she helped
     me identify all the flowers. We saw beautiful sunsets, and I got to
     bike and run around the island during my free time away from the conference. I
     also got to present my research on the health patterns associated with historic
     discriminatory housing policy, which I hope to be able to share soon!</p>

  <p>Here are just a few pictures from our trip that don't nearly do it justice:</p>
