    <p>Hello everyone! I'm starting a new monthly blog post where I reflect on my favorite
    things from the month and look forward into my next month. I may add more categories
    as I continue, but this is what I have for now!</p>

    <p>This one is particularly relevant this month as our country grapples with our past, present, and future decisions around immigration. This poem breaks my heart every time I read it, but I think it's so important for everyone to read and reread and remind ourselves of the choices being made by others that we may not even be able to conceptualize.</p>
