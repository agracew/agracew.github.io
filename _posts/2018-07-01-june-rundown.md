Hello everyone! I'm starting a new monthly blog post where I reflect on my favorite
things from the month and look forward into my next month. I may add more categories
as I continue, but this is what I have for now!

## Poem
### Home by Warsan Shire
This one is particularly relevant this month as our country grapples with our past,
present, and future decisions around immigration. This poem breaks my heart every
time I read it, but I think it's so important for everyone to read and reread and
remind ourselves of the choices being made by others that we may not even be able
to conceptualize.
