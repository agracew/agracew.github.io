  <section id="one">
    <p>Hello everyone! I'm starting a new monthly blog post where I reflect on my favorite
    things from the month and look forward into my next month. I may add more categories
    as I continue, but this is what I have for now!</p>

  <h3>Article or otherwise useful academic resource</h3>
  <p>This section is intended to be an interesting or thought provoking journal article or news article that I read during the month. Is it bad that this will sometimes be a tweet? The people I follow are so helpful!</p>

    <h5><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/palmer-luckey-anduril-border-wall/?ex_cid=SigDig" target="blank">Inside Palmer Luckey's Bid to Build a Border Wall by Steven Levy</a></h5>
  <p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ site.github.url}}/images/blog/June/article_thumb.jpg" alt="" /></span>This month, I read an article that once again made me wonder what our future will look like as we continue to develop new technology at the rate we are. We often whisper about the ethics involved, but articles like this make me wonder how often those whispers make it to the decision-making table.</p>

  <h3>Poem</h3>

      <h3>Read here</h3>
    </article>
    <p>This one is particularly relevant this month as our country grapples with our past, present, and future decisions around immigration. This poem breaks my heart every time I read it, but I think it's so important for everyone to read and reread and remind ourselves of the choices being made by others that we may not even be able to conceptualize.</p>

  <h5>"Make Me Feel" by Janelle Monae</h5>

  <p>This whole album is so fun and great! But this song is the one I've definitely kept on repeat this month.</p>

  <h5>"Dining Alone" by Shakey Graves</h5>

  <p>I got to see him live at the end of May, and this song hadn't stuck out to me until
  he performed it, explained it, and acted it out. It was great.</p>
  <br>

  <h5>"The Deep" by clipping.</h5>

  <p>There is so much going on in this song! It's great! And a quick preview to the podcast section - Switched on Pop is the reason I know about this song, and they have a great episode about it.</p>

  <p>Shout out to Adam Vandusen for recommending this podcast to me!! (This will likely
    be a common theme of my podcast section - he has great podcast recs). I've already told so many people about this podcast because I absolutely love it. They break down pop songs to understand all the cool hidden elements in them that we hear but may never notice. This was the first episode I heard, but so far I have listened to as many as I could and loved them all (except one).</p>
