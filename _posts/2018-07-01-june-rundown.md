Hello everyone! I'm starting a new monthly blog post where I reflect on my favorite
things from the month and look forward into my next month. I may add more categories
as I continue, but this is what I have for now!

## Poem
### Home by Warsan Shire
This one is particularly relevant this month as our country grapples with our past,
present, and future decisions around immigration. This poem breaks my heart every
time I read it, but I think it's so important for everyone to read and reread and
remind ourselves of the choices being made by others that we may not even be able
to conceptualize.

## Music
### "Make Me Feel" by Janelle Monae
This whole album is so fun and great! But this song is the one I've definitely kept
on repeat this month.

### "Dining Alone" by Shakey Graves
I got to see him live at the end of May, and this song hadn't stuck out to me until
he performed it, explained it, and acted it out. It was great.

### "The Deep" by clipping.
There is so much going on in this song! It's great! And a quick preview to the podcast
section - Switched on Pop is the reason I know about this song, and they have a great
episode about it.

## Podcast

### Switched on Pop
#### Afrofuturism in Kali Uchis & Clipping (with Daveed Diggs, William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes)
Shout out to Adam Vandusen for recommending this podcast to me!! (This will likely
  be a common theme of my podcast section - he has the best podcast recs). I've already
  told so many people about this podcast because I absolutely love it. They break down pop songs to understand all the cool hidden elements in them that we hear but may never notice. This was the first episode I heard, but so far I have listened to as many as I could and loved them all (except one).
