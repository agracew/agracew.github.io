some thoughts about march:

my birthday month, my mom's birhtday month, women's history month, St Patty's,
beginning of spring, best weather for running (40 degrees I see you),
budding of new life and new growth, usually contains spring break,
maple syrup taps start flowing, feels like the color green,
maybe it's my favorite month?
