    <p>The monthly blog post was too time consuming, so I left if behind for a
    long time. But I've decided to come back and just include the easiest bits,
    which is music choices and maybe some photos and notes.

    <p>Kicked off the month with my very first trip to Chicago with our INFORMS
    chapter! This was so fun, and we got to visit Northwestern's INFORMS chapter
    and learn about our common struggles and the cool initatives they are doing.</p>

      <p> Grateful to have had such a fun group to travel and act like tourists
        with - also found one of the best pies I've ever had (carrot cake pie) </p>
        <p> We decided to make a pit stop in a cool little lake town on the way
          home, which was definitely worth the 20 extra minutes added to the trip.
        I'm constantly learning how many pretty places exist in Michigan! </p>
