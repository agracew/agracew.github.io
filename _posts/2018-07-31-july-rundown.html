    <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my newly established monthly blog post where I reflect on my
      favorite things from the month. The categories are subject to change in the future,
      and suggestions are always welcome!

  <h2>Article or otherwise useful academic resource</h2>
  <p>This section is intended to be an interesting or thought provoking journal article
     or news article that I read during the month. It's also possible it will be
   a tweet, or a thread from twitter. (because I follow great people with interesting
   perspectives!)</p>

      <h3>Some crazy insight about your eyes! (from twitter)</h3>
      <p>Thanks to @Foone on twitter,
        who I actually don't follow, so I'm unfortunately unsure how this came up on my timeline, but I'm glad it did! The human body is so
        crazy, and this is a crazy dive into some of the weird things about our eyes. Oh and a warning that this contains vulgar
      language, and the grammar will seem strange because it's a series of tweets pasted together.</p>

      <h3>How an Ex-Cop Rigged McDonald’s Monopoly Game and Stole Millions</h3>
      <p>Ok I was actually
      very set on the eye article from early in the month, but I just read this story on July 30th, and it's so crazy to me?? Like who
    knew this is what happened to McDonald's monopoly? Some of you might've. I had no idea. So I'm sharing it.</p>

  <p>The theme of the month may be that I'm not good at choosing just one thing to feature, but
  these two poems I think deserve a pass for the very clear parallels to be drawn between them.</p>
  <!--- potentially an excerpt from "On the Nature of Things"

<h2>Music</h2>
</header>
  <h5>"Slow Clouds" by The Kruger Brothers</h5>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4CNsY8xEXwCXgMDmXrhJnO" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>Shout out to Justin Haney for recommending we go to this concert in early July! This song is beautiful,
  and the Kruger Brothers are so so talented. (And based out of NC these days). We got to hear the story of
  this song, which was written as the soundtrack to a perfect day, inspired by a time one of the brothers
  found a strawberry field and ate so many strawberries he fell asleep in the field and didn't get in trouble
  for coming home late. But listening to it definitely makes me feel like I'm in some perfect day of my own.</p>
  <br>

  <h5>"Dance Me to the End of Love" by The Civil Wars</h5>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6tZAbv5JEsfqjTpkBOrLje" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>This album came out while I was in high school and made me fall in love with
  the Civil Wars, and I have just this month rediscovered my love for their music, although
sadly they broke up in 2014. But they still have several lovely albums on Spotify for your ears to enjoy!</p>

  <p>Shout out this month to Connor Riley for the pod suggestion! I just started rereading the Harry Potter series
  when he told me about this very fun podcast that takes a deep dive into all the books and movies. So far
I have read the first two books and listened to almost all of the corresponding episodes for those (which seems like a crazy amount
of time, but the podcasts are great for commuting and running!) The hosts were sometimes a little much when I first started listening,
but at this point I'm hooked and now feel like they're great people I know and like. #McGalleonthechronicgambler</p>

  </header>
  <h4>International Conference on Transport and Health 2018</h4>
  <p>This month, I had the privilege to attend this fun and interesting conference on
    Mackinac Island, which I have to say is one of the most beautiful places I've
    ever been. We were there the week after the lilac festival, so there were beautiful
    lilacs still in bloom along with all kinds of other flowers that typically are done
    blooming by this time of the year in Asheville. There are no cars on this island that is 8 miles in circumference,
    so all transportation is through non-motorized transport like walking,
    horse-drawn carriages, and bicycles, which was interesting for the theme of
    the conference (transport and health). There are also twelve(12!) fudge shops on
    this tiny island, which I suppose was less perfect for the health part of the theme.
     I was able to bring my mom with  me, which made it even more fun, and she helped
     me identify all the flowers. We saw beautiful sunsets, and I got to
     bike and run around the island during my free time away from the conference. I
     also got to present my research on the health patterns associated with historic
     discriminatory housing policy, which I hope to be able to share soon!</p>

  <p>Here are just a few pictures from our trip that don't nearly do it justice:</p>
