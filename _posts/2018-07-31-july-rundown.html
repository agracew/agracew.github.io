    <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my newly established monthly blog post where I reflect on my
      favorite things from the month. The categories are subject to change in the future,
      and suggestions are always welcome!

  <h2>Article or otherwise useful academic resource</h2>
  <p>This section is intended to be an interesting or thought provoking journal article
     or news article that I read during the month. It's also possible it will be
   a tweet, or a thread from twitter. (because I follow great people with interesting
   perspectives!)</p>

    <h3><a href="https://threader.app/thread/1014267515696922624" target="blank"><u>Some crazy insight about your eyes! (from twitter)</u></a></h3>
  <p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ site.github.url}}/images/blog/July/eye_article.png" alt="" /></span>Thanks to @Foone on twitter,
    who I actually don't follow, so I'm unfortunately unsure how this came up on my timeline, but I'm glad it did! The human body is so
    crazy, and this is a crazy dive into some of the weird things about our eyes. Oh and a warning that this contains vulgar
  language, and the grammar will seem strange because it's a series of tweets pasted together.</p>

    <p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ site.github.url}}/images/blog/July/mcdonalds.webp" alt="" /></span>Ok I was actually
    very set on the eye article from early in the month, but I just read this story on July 30th, and it's so crazy to me?? Like who
  knew this is what happened to McDonald's monopoly? Some of you might've. I had no idea. So I'm sharing it.</p>

  <h2>Poem</h2>
  </header>

  <p>The theme of the month may be that I'm not good at choosing just one thing to feature, but
  these two poems I think deserve a pass for the very clear parallels to be drawn between them.</p>
  <!--- potentially an excerpt from "On the Nature of Things"
        found on this http://classics.mit.edu/Carus/nature_things.2.ii.html
        with info here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_rerum_natura

      <p>I came across this poem earlier in the month and then again when
        the author shared it on twitter on July 26th, the day that would have been Emmett Till's 77th birthday.
      She described it as "an alternate universe where I saw him at the grocery store."</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
</header>
  <h5>"Slow Clouds" by The Kruger Brothers</h5>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4CNsY8xEXwCXgMDmXrhJnO" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>Shout out to Justin Haney for recommending we go to this concert in early July! This song is beautiful,
  and the Kruger Brothers are so so talented. (And based out of NC these days). We got to hear the story of
  this song, which was written as the soundtrack to a perfect day, inspired by a time one of the brothers
  found a strawberry field and ate so many strawberries he fell asleep in the field and didn't get in trouble
  for coming home late. But listening to it definitely makes me feel like I'm in some perfect day of my own.</p>
  <br>

  <h5>"Dance Me to the End of Love" by The Civil Wars</h5>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6tZAbv5JEsfqjTpkBOrLje" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>This album came out while I was in high school and made me fall in love with
  the Civil Wars, and I have just this month rediscovered my love for their music, although
sadly they are no longer a band together. But they still have several lovely albums on Spotify for your ears to enjoy!</p>

  <p>Shout out this month to Connor Riley for the pod suggestion! I just started rereading the Harry Potter series
  when he told me about this very fun podcast that takes a deep dive into all the books and movies. So far
I have read the first two books and listened to almost all of the corresponding episodes for those (which seems like a crazy amount
of time, but the podcasts are great for commuting and running!) The hosts were sometimes a little much when I first started listening,
but at this point I'm hooked and now feel like they're great people I know and like. #McGalleonthechronicgambler</p>

  <h4>I got to go home!</h4>
  <p>This month, I was so lucky to get a few days to visit my home in Asheville, NC (my favorite place to be).
  I got to spend some wonderful time with my family making blackberry jelly, visiting the Biltmore Estate, and
saying goodbye to my sweet first car and moving on to my second. I feel so very blessed
when I think about my family and friends and how much love and support I get from them, and I feel
lucky again every time I get to go home to this wonderful place! Thanks to Zack for making the trip with me,
Alexis for driving up to see me during the weekend, my dad for hosting all of us, my mom and gramma for teaching me
to make jelly for the first time and taking me blackberry picking, my grandpa for all his
definitely helpful comments during the jelly-making process, and my wonderful roommate Lauren for taking
care of Charles in my absence. I have such wonderful people around me!</p>

  <p>Here are some pictures of our adventure!</p>

      <p>This isn't actually a new recipe to me, but I made it again this month
        and I love it. I don't have a food processor, but the blender still does
        the job, and the recipe isn't too hard to make. I've been trying to cook
      vegan when I make dinner at home (my roommate and I alternate), so most of
    the recipes I post will probably be vegan even if the dining out posts aren't.</p>
