  <h2>Article or otherwise useful academic resource</h2>
  <p>This section is intended to be an interesting or thought provoking journal article
     or news article that I read during the month. It's also possible it will be
   a thread from twitter. (because I follow great people with interesting
   perspectives!)</p>

  <h3><a href="https://steps-centre.org/publication/pathways-to-sustainability-an-overview-of-the-steps-centre-approach/" target="blank"><u>Pathways to Sustainability: an overview of the STEPS Centre approach</u></a></h3>
  <p><span class="image left"><img src="{{ site.github.url}}/images/blog/September/STEPScentre.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
    I found this article when looking for some inspiration for a fellowship
    application. I wasn't actually familiar with the STEPS (Social, Technological
     and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) Centre before this article,
     but it's a really interesting perspective about what we mean when we say
     "sustainability," because we throw that word around often. I think it's
     definitely worth a read for anyone doing research or work in or around
     sustainability to make sure we are questioning for whom our "sustainability"
     goals have been formed and how the steps taken to achieve those goals affect
     more than just ourselves.

  <p>Shoutout to Claire Schwartz (<a href="https://twitter.com/23cschwartz" target="blank"><u>@23cschwartz</u></a>
    on twitter), a stranger who tweeted a thread of poems that "teach me how to
    care, that offer care." I know we can also use a little more care for ourselves
    and each other. The full thread can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/23cschwartz/status/1045447504832147456"
  target="blank"><u>here</u></a>, but I posted two of my favorites below.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
</header>
  <h3>NFWMB by Hozier</h3>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2iQYqdalv245vrCEM4W9N9" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>New music from Hozier dropped this month! It's been quite some time, and I can't
  lie, I was hoping for more than 4 songs, but I'll take whatever he gives us!
 I'm a fan of the whole EP, but this was my favorite song on first listen.</p>
  <br>

  <p>So to be real, Mac Miller's death hit me really hard this month. I still
    can't even really conceptualize it, and it feels strange to feel so sad for
    a person I never personally knew. But I guess that speaks to the power of
    music and artists. He seemed like a fun, kind, and genuine soul,
    and I'm hopeful that he has found peace now away from his demons on earth.</p>

  <h3>Watching Movies with the Sound Off by Mac Miller</h3>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1wpin6CIQlmEUuZvALQSVw" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>An older Mac Miller song for your ears. I started listening to his music
  because of this album. The whole album is good.</p>
  <br>

  <p><a href="https://genius.com/a/the-endless-remaking-of-mac-miller?utm_source=home_featured_stories"
    target="blank"><u>Here</u></a>'s a Genius article about Mac's life and career, and
    <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/mac-miller-swimming-interview-profile-706164/"
    target="blank"><u>here</u></a> is an interview he did with Rolling Stones
    shortly before he passed. I guess the title seems really counter to reality now,
    which may be a lesson. Sometimes we think we're ok or we want everyone to think
    that we are, but we're not. He shared this article on twitter and called
    it a good read, and it talks about how he was doing and how his life
    was more normal than people liked to make it sound.</p>

    <h4>Finding Fixes</h4>
    <h5>A podcast about finding solutions to the opioid epidemic</h5>
  </header>
  <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/6mMk555nW22A0DMzkqYVJZ" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
  <p>This podcast has released 5 episodes so far, but each of them are very interesting
  and only about 25 minutes long. Each episode discusses an approach
or solution currently in place (often just regionally) that has some potential to help the
opioid crisis on a large scale. Most of their research and interviews were
completed in the Pacific Northwest. This is a hopeful
and action-oriented podcast that I definitely recommend. I found it after reading
<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/8/23/17769392/opioid-epidemic-drug-overdose-death-study"
target="blank"><u>this</u></a> article that shows that we need a comprehensive
portfolio of solutions to start making a real reduction in the number of people
dying or staying addicted.</p>

  <h4>Adventures with Zack!</h4>
  <p>Guys I got to hang out with this man 4 out of 5 weekends in September!</p>

  <p>We went camping! All by ourselves. Without a reservation. On Labor Day
  Weekend! And it only rained most of the time. But it was great.</p>

      <p>First of all I want to give a shoutout to Aengus, the Good Luck Troll,
      for his help in getting us a campsite. Will definitely be bringing him
    on all future adventures. (And thank you to my grandpa for getting everyone
    in the family our own trolls!)</p>

    <p>We started the weekend by kayaking with my research group, and we only flipped
      the kayak once on this peaceful river float. :)</p>

    <p>We roadtripped up to check out the state forest campgrounds around Traverse
      City with only the best snacks, and we had a pretty great setup. We actually
       found a site in the second place we looked!
    I was skeptical, but it turns out you totally can fit an air mattress in a Kia
  Soul, and it's particularly helpful when it rains all night!</p>

<p>Day 2 of our adventure was spent exploring Traverse City and Old Mission
  Penninsula, which is a tiny penninsula FILLED with wineries and cool farms.</p>

fun and manageable, and I'm so happy you're in it! Even if I wish you lived a little
closer and could be in it more.</p>
